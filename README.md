### Folder Structure
To create sustainable and understandable structure, I tried to collapse all related files under a folder also I have followed global rules for people who will try to understand codes.
- Endpoints are located under routes/ folder inside of their related js file.
- Logical processes related to the endpoints took place under controller folder.
- All process handler such as Auth-validation and Content-validation is located under handler folder.
- Authentication controls and determination of errors according to validation schemes are located under middlewares folder.
